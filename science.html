        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>We collaborate with African researchers and research institutions towards the promotion of research and development; the recruitment of study participants and to generate genetic information.</p>
        <p>This allows us to gather aggregated and de-identified data on the African population which would prove useful for generating new insights and result in high impact publications.</p>

      <h3>Our Focus Areas</h3>
      <p>54gene is currently focused on genomic studies in the following areas:</p>

      <div class="tab">
        <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'non-communicable')">Non-Communicable Diseases</button>
        <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'infectious')">Infectious Diseases</button>
      </div>
      
      <div id="non-communicable" class="tabcontent">
        <p>In 2015, NCDs accounted for 40 million of the 56 million global deaths. Since then, the burden of disease has been on the rise affecting people, families and communities while the genetic basis of highly prevalent NCDs across Africa remains relatively unknown. In this focus area, we are studying the following diseases: Cancer, Endocrine disorders, Neuro-degenerative diseases, Cardiovascular disease, Sickle Cell Disease</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="infectious" class="tabcontent">
        <p>Infectious diseases are disorders caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. These diseases account for a high percentage of mortality across African populations. Understanding the genetic basis of these diseases will provide new insights that could enhance treatment. In this focus area, we intend to study infectious diseases that are particularly prevalent across Africa.</p>

        <h3>The 54gene Biobank™</h3>
        <p>The 54gene Biobank™ is our state-of-the-art biorepository. It is a facility which stores biological samples in the right conditions so the sample retains its integrity for when it is needed for research.</p>
        <p>Our biobank is currently located in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, with the goal of serving as a resource for the global health community to ensure Africans benefit from cutting edge medical innovation.</p>
        <p>The purpose our biobank serves is to provide access to aggregated data, de-identified samples and bio-specimen mainly for secondary use by researchers. We are equally open to supporting both academic and development research.</p>
        <p>Our dedicated clinical and research teams are committed to using our vast genetic database to support development of therapeutics including drugs and vaccines for non-communicable and communicable diseases in various ways.</p>
